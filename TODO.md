- DONE add size/width to HVs

- DONE drawable:
  - pos
  - direction
  - local2world
  - drawLine
- DONE drawable type class?
  - local2world 

- DONE do we want helper funcs for HVs
  - length, corners etc
  - and/or do we want coord transformations?

- different colours for resources
  - use for sources and sensors

- DONE add sensor/driver

- DONE calculate speed from drivers
  - forward speed is mean?

- DONE calculate rotation from drivers
  - turn proportional to diff between L and R speed?

- fix theta interpretation

- DONE vehicle type 1:
  - sensor
  - driver

- add some random shunting (of direction)

- Vehicle 3
  - add inhibitory
    - add negator
    - and new driver type?
      - or add speed calculator to driver?

- generalise source/sink of signals
  - allow for thresholding, multiple connections etc

- have 'info tick' as distinct to 'draw+physics tick'
  - 3 ticks? info == physics?

- collision detection?
